# behavelyope

A behavioral research engine for neuroscience research... with ambylopes.

## By Amblyopes For Amblyopes

Some say that the developer is an amblyope. He says he doesn't know.

## Installation Instructions

1. Get conda (python 2.7)
2. Run the following commands:
```bash
bash install.sh
```

Done, you now have a conda environment called `behavelyope` that has everything you need.
If you are silly enough to run components of this yourself, then you can go ahead and activate 
the conda environment with `source activate behavelyope`.  Otherwise you can use the binaries.

## Running Perimetry Task

You can run the perimetry task and specify the config file. First, cd into the behavlyope directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrabadi/behavlyope.git && cd behavlyope
bash perimetryTask -c config.txt
```

Note, you can specify your own config file.

## Convering data to csv

You can convert the saved data into a csv file with the `convert_data.py` script.

```
python convert_data.py input_data_file_name output_file_name
```

where `input_data_file_name` is a file generated by behavelyope and `output_file_name` is where you want to save the csv version of the data.
